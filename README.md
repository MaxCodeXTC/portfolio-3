# Welcome to my Portfolio
_under construction_

I started building this Portfolio as a project, when I was in the [Udacity/Google scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The website is still under construction, and only visitable by browser with a width larger than 1024 pixels.

* I've added a visual effect **_Animating Link Underlines_**, that I found at [Tobias Bjerrome Ahlin's](http://tobiasahlin.com/) [blog](http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/css-trick-animating-link-underlines/).

* I implemented an image shuffler in the **_words about me_** section. Order of images will change on refresh, or re-entering the page. Link of resource will be added soon.

* I built a version of d3.js [DashBoard](http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/96447623ef4d342ee09b) to visualize my skills by theoretical, practical and autonomous variables.


Please visit the live version of my Portfolio by a device wider than 1024 pixels, [here](https://annaunger.github.io/portfolio/).
