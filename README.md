# Welcome to my Portfolio
_under construction_

I started building this Portfolio as a project, when I was in the [Udacity/Google scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The website is still under construction, and only visitable by browser with a width larger than 1024 pixels.

* I've added a visual effect **_Animating Link Underlines_**, that I found at [Tobias Bjerrome Ahlin's](http://tobiasahlin.com/) [blog](http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/css-trick-animating-link-underlines/).

* I implemented an image shuffler in the **_words about me_** section, order of images will change on refresh, or re-entering the page. Link of resource will be added soon.

Please visit the live version of my Portfolio by a device wider than 1024 pixels, [here](https://annaunger.github.io/portfolio/).






## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/annaunger/portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/annaunger/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
